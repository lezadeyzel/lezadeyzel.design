            <p>The haircare market in South Africa is forecasted to grow by approximately 5.7% over the next five years. Although the haircare industry has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant hair salon closures, there has been an increase in demand for hair care services as lockdown levels decrease. The pandemic has necessitated hairstylists to reconsider how they reach and service clients. For example, due to health concerns, some clients may prefer for a hairstylist to visit them at home.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I was interested in creating a digital product (mobile app) for users to be able to find a hairstylist near to them. The app was envisioned as one space to enable users to quickly find a hairstylist near to them, select a hairstylist based on the information provided, and for the user to be able to book an appointment.</li>
                <li>The users I had in mind are busy professionals who need an easy way to search for a hairstylist and make a decision to try a specific hairstylist.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>I used the double diamond design framework to structure my work on this project.

            This non-linear framework enables one to:
            
        <div>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Discover (through research)</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Although users are able to use existing digital platforms to search for a hairstylist (e.g. Google Search and Maps), the challenge is that the process can be haphazard and difficult to navigate especially for users that are not tech-savvy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>A mobile app that can enable users to search for a hairstylist close to them, view information about the hairstylist and their portfolios, select a hairstylist, and book an appointment. The user can also save their preferences in the app, making it easy to go back to the information they need should they need to search for a hairstylist again.</p>

            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>During the discovery phase, I wanted to learn about how users currently find a hairstylist and book haircare appointments and how they experience their current method of finding a hairstylist (if necessary) and booking an appointment. I conducted semi-structured user interviews to explore and gain a deeper understanding of users’ needs and behaviours.</p>

                <p>The initial sketches included the loading screen, main view, and what the search results might look like. I started by doing sketches on paper to capture my concepts for these screens as informed by the user interview insights.

                The second iteration of the papers sketches was informed by applying design principles:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users’ past experience shape their expectations - for example, to save something for later, they would expect to see a bookmark icon.</li>
                        <li>User’s emotions are affected by design - the use of visual components (e.g. images, colour) will affect user’s emotions.</li>
                        <li>Don’t let users think - a designer must reduce the burden on the user.</li>
                    </ul>

            <div>
            
                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Once the clickable low-fidelity prototype was completed, I conducted usability sessions with 2 users.</p>
                <p><strong>My process:</strong></p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>Create usability guide with introductory script and 3 usability tasks (complete sign in flow, complete sign up flow, and complete search for hairstylist flow).
                    </li>
                    <li>Scheduled Zoom sessions with users and provided them with control of my screen in order for them to complete the tasks on the Figma prototype.</li>
                    <li>Documented the session</li>
                </ul>    

                <h3>Usability study insights and iteration of design</h3>
                <p>It was interesting for me to observe how users completed the tasks and what their challenges were. As a result of the usability tests, I made changes to the prototype to address the following usability issues:
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>Users expected a Sign in/up with… option and therefore I added Sign in/up with Google, Facebook, or Apple in addition to the app username and password option.</li>
                    <li>Users were confused in terms of the Cancel button on the Sign up screen since they were not sure what happens if they click on it. I changed the wording on the button to Sign in to indicate that this is where they will go when clicking on it.</li>
                    <li>Users were surprised that upon clicking on the “Find me a hairstylist” button on the Main view, there was another screen with the questions related to distance to travel and budget. I therefore removed this additional screen and placed these questions on the Main view.</li>
                    <li>In the search results, users were not sure if the rating was for the hair salon or the hairstylist. I moved the name of the hairsalon so that it is not grouped with the rating in order to avoid confusion.</li>

                <h3>UI Design</h3>
                <p>After testing the views, I created a high-fidelity prototype that reflected the findings from the usability study. I aimed for a minimal design using design principles such as balance, white space, alignment, and a clear visual hierarchy. The Figma design file also contained a Style Guide and Pattern Library to ensure a continuous brand experience.
                
                <h4>Accessibility consideration</h4>
                
                <p>I used the WebAim color contrast checker to check for accessibility in terms of color. All the elements on the screens passed on WCAG AA and AAA levels. I decided to increase the font on the “small print” in order to make it more legible for users with reduced eyesight.</p>

            <p>    After creating the high-fidelity prototype I conducted another usability study with 4 users. The usability study was unmoderated and remote using Lookback.</p><br>
            <p>The <span class="text-emphasis">key insights</span> from the usability test were as follows:</p>
                
            <ul>

                <li>There were conflicting opinions about the “Not important” option for selecting the preferred distance to travel and budget. One user felt that the "Not important" options were not working - replace with e.g. Above 40 km and Above R450 whereas another user found the “Not important” option a good feature.</li>
                <li>The buttons for choosing travel and budget are not clear when selected (there is too small a change between the unselected and active button.</li>
                <li>One user found that the peach colour used for the Salon name on the Results view was difficult to read.</li>
                <li>One user commented on the search filter questions (“How far are you willing to travel” and “How much are you willing to pay”) as not standing out enough - could easily be missed.</li>
                <li>Users were able to sign up without any challenges and also found it easy to perform the search for a hairstylist.</li>

                <p><strong>KPI:</strong> Increase task success rate</p><br>
                <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
                <p>Users may not notice when options are selected for travel distance and budget. Changing the active state of the option buttons may assist the user to know that they have selected the option and can now proceed to click on the “Find me a stylist” button.</p>

                <h3>What I learnt</h3>
                <p><strong>Be organised</strong> It is important to have a framework and an understanding of the non-linear process to help you find your way in a project. It is important to document your process and decisions throughout the process in order to reflect on what eventually worked more effectively to solve the problem. On a practical level it is important to be organised when working in Figma especially with creating and naming components in order to capitalise on automatic updates across all screens

                I will start building a case study as I start working on a new project and keep visuals and reflections updated throughout the project.
                    
                I need to complete a further course specifically about Figma and also practice more.
                </p>

                <h3>What’s next</h3>
                <p>I intend to continue designing this app in order to further iterate on my learning. I continue to learn about UX design.
