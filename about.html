            <p>I want to live in a world where design is thoughtful, relevant and meaningful and where writing is clear. My goal is to help individuals and organisations grow for the common good.
            <p>I am curious to know what others do with technology, how they think, feel and behave, and how technology can improve the lives of others. By observing, asking questions, listening, and building knowledge systems, I can help others connect the dots.</p>
            <p>I have spent most of my career listening to others, developing digital products and supporting students in the context of higher education. My extensive experience in the distance learning industry has prepared me well for UX research and writing roles.</p>
            <p>My interests include design thinking, UX design, research and writing. I have a Master's degree in Psychology with a focus on Research Consulting. I am currently taking a deep dive into learning about UX design through completing courses, research, and writing.</p>
            <p>I am also deepening my knowledge of front-end web development (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and currently busy with a Front-end developer career path course through Scrimba.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Master of Science (MSc) degree in Psychology (Research Consultation) at the University of South Africa</h3>
            <p>I completed my Master's degree in Psychology. During this time I gained in-depth experience in mixed methods (different qualitative and quantitative methods), as well as designing research studies and writing research proposals. The Master's degree was a culmination of my work and study journey during which I combined psychology with computer science and information systems to develop more effective digital student support interventions.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>User Experience Nanodegree at Udacity</h3>
            <p>I completed the User Experience Nanodegree at Udacity to transition to a career in UX. The programme enabled me to complete a design for a mobile app through user research, developing low-fi and high-fi prototypes, handing over to developers, and monitoring app performance. Finally the programme, supported me to develop my first UX portfolio.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>UX Writing Fundamentals at UX Writers Collective</h3>
            <p>This course introduced me to working with voice and tone, best writing practices for UX writing, writing for UI components, UX writing deliverables and working with teams. The course culminated in a practical project to provide a content style guide and provide input for an app design based on the style guide created.</p>

            <h3>Qualitative and Quantitative Research</h3>
            <p>I started my career in psychology as a student counsellor and developed skills crucial to UX research, such as interviews, data analysis, and report-writing. I have experience in conducting mixed-methods studies and feel equally comfortable with quantitative and qualitative research methods.</p>
