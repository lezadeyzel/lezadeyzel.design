            <p>I am an <em><strong>infinitely curious creator</strong></em> - I make for use and for fun - to learn and share with others. I listen to what others need and create useful and usable designs that align with what they imagined and more. I believe in the power of technology to create communities where all individuals can learn and grow.</p>    
            <p>I am a <em><strong>creative problem-solver</strong></em> - I rely on information and reflection to solve problems.</p>
            <p><em><strong>I value</strong></em> quality, diversity, integrity and above all else: kindness.</p>
            <p><em><strong>I have spent most of my career</strong></em> listening to others, empathising, researching, and creating digital products to support students in a higher education context. I'm excited to bring these skills to user experience design, research, and writing and to partner with organisations that support people to grow and learn. In a way, I have been applying UX principles my whole career. My passion for research and creating solutions that work inspired me to complete an MSc in Psychology (Research Consultation). I have worked in diverse teams, and the last 18 months of my previous job was in a remote context where I could be relied on to complete my work and innovate.</p>
            <p>Currently, <em><strong>I am immersing myself</em></strong> in learning UX design, research, and writing. I have completed the Udacity User Experience Nanodegree, UX Writers Collective UX Writing Fundamentals course. I am a member of the Interaction Design Foundation. I have completed these courses through IDF: Becoming a UX Designer From Scratch, Data-Driven Design: Quantitative Research for UX, and User Research: Methods and Best Practices courses.</p>
            <p><em><strong>My interests</em></strong> include applying psychological principles to UX design and research, design thinking and behaviourial economics. I am also learning front-end web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</p>

            <h3>Master of Science (MSc) degree in Psychology (Research Consultation) at the University of South Africa</h3>
            <p>I completed my Master's degree in Psychology. During this time I gained in-depth experience in mixed methods (different qualitative and quantitative methods), as well as designing research studies and writing research proposals. The Master's degree was a culmination of my work and study journey during which I combined psychology with computer science and information systems to develop more effective digital student support interventions.</p>

            <h3>User Experience Nanodegree at Udacity</h3>
            <p>I completed the User Experience Nanodegree at Udacity to transition to a career in UX. The programme enabled me to complete a design for a mobile app through user research, developing low-fi and high-fi prototypes, handing over to developers, and monitoring app performance. Finally the programme, supported me to develop my first UX portfolio.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>UX Writing Fundamentals at UX Writers Collective</h3>

The course culminated in a practical project to provide a content style guide and provide input for an app design based on the style guide created.</p>
